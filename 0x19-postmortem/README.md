# Postmortem: Outage in Web Stack Service

Issue Summary:
Duration: June 15, 2023, 09:00 AM to June 16, 2023, 01:00 PM (PST)
Impact: The web stack service experienced downtime, resulting in slow response times and intermittent availability. Approximately 75% of users were affected during the outage, leading to a degraded user experience and potential loss of business.

Timeline:
- June 15, 2023, 09:15 AM: The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a sudden increase in response times.
- The operations team immediately initiated an investigation to determine the root cause of the issue.
- Initial assumption: A recent code deployment may have introduced a performance regression.
- Several code repositories and deployment configurations were analyzed to identify any potential code changes causing the issue.
- A misdiagnosis occurred when a specific code change was identified as the root cause. The team focused efforts on reverting the change, but the issue persisted.
- June 15, 2023, 10:30 AM: The incident was escalated to the engineering team for further analysis.
- The engineering team conducted a thorough examination of the infrastructure, including the networking layer, load balancers, and database servers.
- The investigation revealed a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to improper distribution of traffic across backend servers.
- The incident was escalated to the network operations team to rectify the load balancer configuration.
- June 16, 2023, 01:00 PM: The incident was resolved, and normal service was restored.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The issue originated from a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing uneven distribution of traffic and leading to overloaded backend servers.

Resolution: The network operations team corrected the load balancer configuration by adjusting the weight distribution algorithm and ensuring proper scaling of backend resources. This ensured a more balanced traffic distribution and alleviated the strain on individual servers.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
1. Improve Monitoring: Enhance monitoring capabilities to promptly detect performance regressions and abnormal traffic patterns. Implement alerts to notify the team of any load balancer-related anomalies.
   - Task: Implement comprehensive monitoring using a combination of server metrics, response times, and load balancer health checks.

2. Configuration Management: Strengthen configuration management processes to minimize the risk of misconfigurations.
   - Task: Implement a configuration review process with multi-tier approvals to ensure accurate and validated changes.

3. Load Testing and Autoscaling: Conduct periodic load testing to assess the system's capacity and implement autoscaling mechanisms to handle increased traffic effectively.
   - Task: Develop load testing scenarios and perform regular stress tests on the infrastructure. Integrate autoscaling to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.

4. Incident Response Training: Enhance the incident response plan and conduct regular training sessions to improve the team's efficiency during critical situations.
   - Task: Organize incident response training sessions to simulate various scenarios, ensuring effective collaboration and rapid incident resolution.

5. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: Maintain up-to-date documentation and promote knowledge sharing within the team to prevent recurring issues and facilitate quicker troubleshooting.
   - Task: Regularly update system documentation, including load balancer configurations, troubleshooting guides, and best practices.

By implementing these measures, we aim to improve system reliability, reduce downtime, and enhance the overall user experience. The lessons learned from this incident will serve as a foundation for building a more resilient web stack service in the future.
